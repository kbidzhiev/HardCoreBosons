Some important notes for future readers:
1) [Gauss-Kronrod](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/gauss_kronrod.html) works better than [Gauss-Legendre](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/gauss.html). Was checked on integration of cos(x) [-50:50]
